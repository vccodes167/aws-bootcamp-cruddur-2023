### installing AWS-CLI 
I have tried to install aws cli on gitpod terminal using the following code
~~~
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
~~~

i was failed in the first attempt. i was getting following error
![error-aws-cli]("C:\Users\nagis\OneDrive\Desktop\week0_images\error-aws-cli.png")
**note for image**
I have revisted the whole process again and found out that i was swapping keyid for secret access key, then resolved by placing the right creds

![aws-cli-installation]("C:\Users\nagis\OneDrive\Desktop\week0_images\gitpod-user.png") 

**note to image**
Completed CLI installation
